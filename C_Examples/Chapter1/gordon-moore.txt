Moore was born in San Francisco, California and grew up in nearby Pescadero, where his father was the county sheriff. He attended San Jose State University for two years[9] before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley where he received a B.S. degree in chemistry in 1950.[10] In September 1950, Moore enrolled at the California Institute of Technology.[11] While at Caltech, Moore minored in physics and received a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1954.[12][10][13] Moore conducted postdoctoral research at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University from 1953 to 1956. Moore joined MIT and Caltech alumnus William Shockley at the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory division of Beckman Instruments, but left with the "traitorous eight," when Sherman Fairchild agreed to back them and created the influential Fairchild Semiconductor corporation.[14][15]
In 1965, Moore was working as the director of research and development (R&D) at Fairchild Semiconductor. He was asked by Electronics Magazine to predict what was going to happen in the semiconductor components industry over the next ten years. In an article published on April 19, 1965, Moore observed that the number of components (transistors, resistors, diodes, or capacitors)[16] in a dense integrated circuit had doubled approximately every year and speculated that it would continue to do so for at least the next ten years. In 1975, he revised the forecast rate to approximately every two years.[17] Carver Mead popularized the phrase "Moore's law." The prediction has become a target for miniaturization in the semiconductor industry and has had widespread impact in many areas of technological change.
In 2000, Moore and his wife established the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, with a gift worth about $5 billion. Through the Foundation, they initially targeted environmental conservation, science, and the San Francisco Bay Area.[21] The foundation gives extensively in the area of environmental conservation, supporting major projects in the Andes-Amazon Basin and the San Francisco Bay area, among others.[22] Moore was a director of Conservation International for some years. In 2002, he and Conservation International senior vice president Claude Gascon received the Order of the Golden Ark from Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld for their outstanding contributions to nature conservation.[23] Moore  has been a member of Caltech's board of trustees since 1983, chairing it from 1993 to 2000, and is now a life trustee.[24][25][26] In 2001, Moore and his wife donated $600 million to Caltech, at the time the largest gift ever to an institution of higher education.[27] He said that he wants the gift to be used to keep Caltech at the forefront of research and technology.[21] In December 2007, Moore and his wife donated $200 million to Caltech and the University of California for the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), expected to become the world's second largest optical telescope once it and the European Extremely Large Telescope are completed in the mid-2020s. The TMT will have a segmented mirror 30 meters across and be built on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. This mirror will be nearly three times the size of the current record holder, the Large Binocular Telescope.[28] The Moores, as individuals and through their foundation, have also, in a series of gifts and grants beginning in the 1990s, given some $150 million to the University of California, Berkeley to fund initiatives ranging from materials science and physics to genomics and data science.[29][30] In addition, through the Foundation, his wife created the Betty Irene Moore Nursing Initiative, targeting nursing care in the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Sacramento.[21][31] In 2007, the foundation pledged $100 million over 11 years to establish a nursing school at the University of California, Davis.[29] The Moores have also been long-time benefactors of other Northern California institutions, including Stanford University (over $178 million as of 2020), University of California, San Francisco, and University of California, Santa Cruz.[29] In 2009, the Moores received the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy.
